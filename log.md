# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 26, 2018 (Example 1)


**Today's Progress**: Solved the first and second problems on projecteuler.net

**Thoughts:** Felt enjoyable to get code up and running so quickly.



### Day 1: April 27, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Completed problems 3 through to 9 on projecteuler.net

**Thoughts**: Project 8 was quite satisfying as it was searching through a long list of digits that needed preparing.




### Day 2: April 28, 2018 - solved problems 10 and 11 on project euler.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Another satisfying solution - a 400 list of numbers that needed multiplying horizontally, vertically and diagonally.

### Day 3: April 29, 2018 - Sunday - now I've met my match. Problem 12 is about finding a highly divisible triangle number. 

**Today's Progress**: This took a lot of effort - I need to look at the part that finds the divisible numbers.

**Thoughts** Another satisfying solution - a 400 list of numbers that needed multiplying horizontally, vertically and diagonally.

### Day 3: April 30, 2018 - Monday - I came up with a solution with the triangle number. I found the best way to copy a list in place `newlist = oldlist[:]` - addind the slice does this.

### Day 4: May 1, 2018 - Tuesday - solved the Collatz sequence problem - it was straightforward. I'm on a grid walker problem and I'm reading around it and thinking about how I might code all the permutations.
